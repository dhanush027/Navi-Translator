            <p class="txtDisplay">The NaÊ¼vi language has its origins in James Cameron's early work on Avatar.It was created by Paul Frommer.NaÊ¼vi had a growing vocabulary of about a thousand words.However, this has changed subsequently as Frommer has expanded to more than 2600 words and has published the grammar, thus making NaÊ¼vi a relatively complete, learnable and serviceable language.</p>
